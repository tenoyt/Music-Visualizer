# ðŸŽ¶ Circular Music Visualizer

This project is a real-time music visualizer built in Processing. It displays dynamic circular animations that respond to audio input using amplitude and frequency data. The visualizer includes two distinct modes: a smooth circular spectrum and a radial spike burst, both enhanced with rotation, beat detection, and color gradients.

## âœ¨ Features

- Real-time audio response using Minim
- Color gradients from blue to pink
- Rotating visuals with beat-triggered acceleration
- Beat detection using `BeatDetect`
- Two toggleable modes(press m to switch them):
  - Mode 0: Circular spectrum (smooth ring)
  - Mode 1: Radial spikes (starburst)
- Amplitude history trail at the bottom

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Navigate to the Executable folder
2. Either replace the 'your_audio.mp3' file with a file of the same name or use the already existing audio file named `your_audio.mp3`
3. Run MusicVisualizer.exe
